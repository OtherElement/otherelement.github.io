I'll be honest, This isn't really good, but it was worth an attempt. 
I think I tried my best to try to be somewhat different, but it was not worth the headache it gave.
I might come back to redoing this, but for now, **this project is inactive.**
If anything, I might try doing a simpler design or learn to use a static site generator like Jekyll for GitHub Pages, if I do come back to this.
